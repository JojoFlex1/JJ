🌐 Aggregator
Aggregator is a cross-chain dust collection and swapping platform designed to help users consolidate small balances ("dust") from various chains — currently supporting Stellar, StarkNet, and Ethereum (Ethereum support is passive for now).

This MVP allows users to connect their wallets, select token balances across chains, and seamlessly transfer and swap them into a preferred stable currency like USDC on Stellar.

🚀 Features
🔗 Multi-chain support:

✅ Stellar (Active)

✅ StarkNet (Active)

🕓 Ethereum (Passive only; no logic yet)

🧠 Smart dust collection flow:

Connect your wallet

View and select token balances

Transfer selected tokens for processing

Swap them into USDC (or another Stellar currency)

💰 Minimum Threshold:
To maintain efficiency, there's a minimum required amount for processing. Tiny fractions are ignored or bundled as needed for gas optimization.

🧭 Usage Flow
Connect your wallet

Click the Connect Wallet button to link your Stellar or StarkNet wallet.

Select balances

Once connected, available balances are shown. You choose which tokens you want to aggregate.

Process balances

The selected tokens are transferred and bundled for aggregation.

Swap to Stellar currency

After processing, tokens can be swapped into a Stellar-based currency such as USDC.

You may choose which Stellar currency to receive.

Close transaction

Once swapped, your balances are ready for withdrawal or donation.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Minimal UI with wallet connection and balance selection interface

Smart Contracts:

Stellar: Handles transfers and swaps

StarkNet: Used for dust balance selection and transfer

Ethereum: Currently no active logic, may be supported in future updates

🧪 Status
This project is an MVP and still under development.
Active logic is being implemented on Stellar and StarkNet only for now. Ethereum is passive — no active transfer or swap logic yet.

🧼 Coming Soon
Full Ethereum integration

UI polish and responsiveness

Donation & withdrawal tracking

Analytics for token collection impact
